# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Applied in Flex Container with Overflowing Child

This repository demonstrates a bug in Tailwind CSS where styles are not applied to elements within a flex container if a child element overflows the parent's bounds.  The issue occurs when an element's width exceeds its parent, pushing the subsequent elements outside the boundaries of the parent, leading to styling issues.

## Bug Description

When an item within a flex container is wider than its parent, subsequent flex items may not be styled correctly by Tailwind CSS.  This happens because the layout breaks out of its containment leading to the styles of the affected elements being disrupted. 

## Solution

The solution is to constrain the width of the overflowing element using `flex-shrink` or `max-width` or by specifying a fixed width. By preventing the overflow, the layout remains contained, and Tailwind CSS styles are applied consistently. We also ensure that the parent container is set to have enough width to accommodate its contents using `flex-wrap` and adjusting the width to meet the space requirements.
